Without using teleportation magic, Rykar has to walk from one dungeon to the next — step by step.
Today, Rykar plans to conquer three dungeons.
The times he needs to walk between them are:
T1​ minutes to reach the first dungeon,
T2 minutes to reach the second dungeon,
T3 minutes to reach the third dungeon.
You must help Rykar calculate the total time, how many hours and minutes he spends walking today!

0 ≤ T1,T2,T3 ≤ 10^10

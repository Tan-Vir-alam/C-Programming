/*Name: Coordunates of a Point.
Problem: Given two numbers X, Y which donate coordinates of a point in 2D plan. Determine in 
which quarter does it belong.
Note:
1. Print Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 according to the quarter in which the point belongs to.
2. Print "Origem" If the point is at the origin.
3. Print "Eixo X" If the point is over X axis.
4. Print "Eixo Y" if the point is over Y axis.

/*Name: Shopping
Problem: Tanvir and Kawser have gone out for shopping, and Tanvir wants to buy a new pair of 
shoes for Eid. He has enough money to buy anything. However, Tanvir will only buy shoes 
if kawser also buys a pair. And kawser will buy a pair of shoes if he can buy a panjabi. That 
means everything depends on the panjabi.

You have decided that kawser will buy a panjabi only if he has more than 1000 Taka. After 
purchasing the panjabi the amount of his money will be reduced by 1000. Suppose kawser 
has 1600 taka with him, after buying the panjabi he will have 600 taka left with him.
Then kawser will only buy shoes if he has 500 Taka or more left. That means, if kawser 
can't buy Punjabi he can't buy shoes.
Now if I inform you of the amount of N taka that Kawser's mother will give him. Can you 
tell me what will happen next?

*If Kawser buys a Panjabi print "KAWSER WILL BUY PANJABI".
*If Kawser buys a pair of Shoes print "KAWSER WILL BUY NEW SH0ES"
*If Tanvir buys a pair of Shoes print "TANVIR WILL BUY NEW SH0ES"
*If no one can buy anything print "BAD LUCK!"
Note: Don't forget to print a new line after every line you print.

/*Problem Name: What's Your Level?
Problem:  These contests are designed to test your limits on the basic concepts of programming. 
There are a total of ten problems. One is at the beginner level if he can solve more 
than two problems. And he is at a good beginner level if he solves more than five problems. 
If someone solves all the problems, he is at an intermediate level. If he doesn't fit any 
of the levels, he should seek for help.
Solved number of problems p is given. Now your task is to display,
. Push Your Limits (if p>2)
. Keep Pace Up (if p>5)
. Way To Go (if p=10)
. Seek For Help (otherwise)

/*Problem Name: Rainbow color
Problem: Did you ever see any rainbows? Rainbows can be caused by many forms of airborne 
water. Rainbows can have many colors, but only seven of them can be seen through human 
eyes. Those are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet. This color sequence 
is called Newton's sevenfold.
Now if this sequence is numbered from 0 to 6. So, if 2 is the input, then the color will 
be "Yellow". You are given a color number, You have to determine the correct color for a 
chosen number.

/*Problem Name: Burger buying dilemm
Problem: Eibrahim, Rifat, and Rikon, three friends with varying financial capacities, have decided to 
satisfy their cravings with burgers.
Eibrahim possesses x taka, Rifat holds y taka, and Rikon carries z taka. However, the price of each 
burger is m taka.
Determine the maximum number of burgers 3 friends can purchase with their combined budget and also 
calculate the exact fractional amount of burger that each one of them will get.
If they buy 4 burgers each person will get 1.33 burger
Input Format: Input contains two lines, first one determining the value of x, y, z and the second 
line contains how much the burger costs(m)

/*Problem Name: Discover new formula
Problem: In a distant village, there were two close friends, Alina and Ben. They stumbled upon a 
hidden cave containing a pair of enchanted amulets that promised extraordinary powers. The 
amulets, when worn together, had the ability to unveil hidden truths.
One day, as they discussed Albert Einstein and researched common formulas, they stumbled upon a 
new formula closely resembling (a-b)^2. However, they decided to experiment with a different 
approach. which is like-
There are three step to solve the problem:
a^2: This term represents the square of the variable a
-(a*b)^2: This term represents the square of the product of a and b..
+b^2: Finally,This term represents the square of the variable b.

In summary, the entire expression calculates a value by taking the square of 'a', subtracting 
the squared product of 'a' and 'b', and then adding square of 'b'. The specific values of 'a' 
and 'b' will determine the numerical outcome of this expression.
lets Combine the formulas and find the value with POSITIVE mind.

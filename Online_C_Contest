/*Name: Shopping
Problem: Tanvir and Kawser have gone out for shopping, and Tanvir wants to buy a new pair of 
shoes for Eid. He has enough money to buy anything. However, Tanvir will only buy shoes 
if kawser also buys a pair. And kawser will buy a pair of shoes if he can buy a panjabi. That 
means everything depends on the panjabi.

You have decided that kawser will buy a panjabi only if he has more than 1000 Taka. After 
purchasing the panjabi the amount of his money will be reduced by 1000. Suppose kawser 
has 1600 taka with him, after buying the panjabi he will have 600 taka left with him.
Then kawser will only buy shoes if he has 500 Taka or more left. That means, if kawser 
can't buy Punjabi he can't buy shoes.
Now if I inform you of the amount of N taka that Kawser's mother will give him. Can you 
tell me what will happen next?

*If Kawser buys a Panjabi print "KAWSER WILL BUY PANJABI".
*If Kawser buys a pair of Shoes print "KAWSER WILL BUY NEW SH0ES"
*If Tanvir buys a pair of Shoes print "TANVIR WILL BUY NEW SH0ES"
*If no one can buy anything print "BAD LUCK!"
Note: Don't forget to print a new line after every line you print.

/*Problem Name: Discover new formula
Problem: In a distant village, there were two close friends, Alina and Ben. They stumbled upon a 
hidden cave containing a pair of enchanted amulets that promised extraordinary powers. The 
amulets, when worn together, had the ability to unveil hidden truths.
One day, as they discussed Albert Einstein and researched common formulas, they stumbled upon a 
new formula closely resembling (a-b)^2. However, they decided to experiment with a different 
approach. which is like-
There are three step to solve the problem:
a^2: This term represents the square of the variable a
-(a*b)^2: This term represents the square of the product of a and b..
+b^2: Finally,This term represents the square of the variable b.

In summary, the entire expression calculates a value by taking the square of 'a', subtracting 
the squared product of 'a' and 'b', and then adding square of 'b'. The specific values of 'a' 
and 'b' will determine the numerical outcome of this expression.
lets Combine the formulas and find the value with POSITIVE mind.

symmetrical triangle, or even a complex polygon with a simple twist and turn.

Problem: In the sprawling depths of an ancient, ominous dungeon, four valiant adventurers - Link, 
Samus, Luigi, and Falcon - embark on a perilous quest. Little do they know, a malevolent curse 
lurks within, sapping their vitality with each passing moment.
The curse, born from centuries of darkness, manifests differently for each hero, testing their 
resilience in unique ways. Link, wielding the legendary Master Sword, finds himself grappling 
with a curse that gnaws at his vitality with an unrelenting, yet manageable intensity. Samus, 
encased in her high-tech Power Suit, faces a curse that, while less aggressive, still threatens 
to diminish her strength. Luigi, the ever-reluctant hero, feels the curse's icy grip tighten 
slightly more, his fear amplifying its effects. And then there's Falcon, the epitome of courage 
and strength, yet even he is not immune, his indomitable spirit tested by the curse's 
relentless onslaught.
As they traverse the dungeon's twisting passages, encountering cursed artifacts and malevolent 
energies, their health points diminish gradually, each step forward exacting a toll on their well-being.
